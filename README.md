This Python program simulates the output of two logic circuits:
1.	Circuit (a)
2.	Circuit (b)
The program takes three binary inputs for A, B and C. Each input represents a Boolean value (1 for True, 0 for False). The program then evaluates the inputs using the Boolean expressions for both circuits and prints their outputs.
# Instructions to user:
1.	Run the program in shell
2.	Enter values for A, B and C when prompted:
-	Use 1 for True
-	Use 0 for False
3.	View the output for Circuit A and Circuit B
# Example:
Please enter input for A, must be 1 for true and 0 for false: 
-	If user enters “1” here
Please enter input for B, must be 1 for true and 0 for false: 
-	If user enters “0” here
Please enter input for C, must be 1 for true and 0 for false: 
-	If user enters “1” here
Then the program should display:
The output of circuit (a) is 1
The output of circuit (b) is 1
